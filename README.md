# href-parser
simple href parser with libcurl easy interfaces AND/OR sockets from scratch with a manually crafted header

notes:
*no one should care about the curl version
*need to come up with a better and more efficient parsing alg'
*need to see if https support is feasible with C, as HTTP requests sent to HTTPS supported sites just results in a 301 in most if not all cases.
I forgot that web servers work like that when I began working on the barebones version lol. Oh well. In your search for one thing, you should always keep your eye open for others.
